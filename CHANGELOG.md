## [Unreleased]

### Added - Phase 4 Task 1: the native surfaces are real (nothing above them is, yet)
- **`Clib/simple_shaping_dwrite.h`** - the production DirectWrite + GDI C shim,
  grown from `spikes/dwrite/Clib/dwrite_spike.h` (which stays byte-identical as
  evidence). Plain C, hand-declared COM vtables, `dwrite.dll` via
  `LoadLibraryW`, `gdi32.lib` via `#pragma comment` - **zero new DLLs**
  (NFR-004). Every buffer is heap-allocated and grows on demand; the spike's
  fixed caps would have truncated a real chat line.
- **`DWRITE_API` bodies are effective**: `open`/`close`/`analyze`, the script
  and bidi run accessors, `create_font_face_from_hdc`/`release_font_face`,
  `shape_run` (em size = the caller's `a_em_size_pixels`, same-N; the run's
  `DWRITE_SCRIPT_ANALYSIS` bytes passed through verbatim; 1.5n+16 first
  allocation with grow-and-retry), the glyph accessors and `cluster_of_unit`.
  The Phase-1 `Hresult_not_implemented` returns are gone: `last_hresult` now
  carries the HRESULT DirectWrite actually returned. Every HRESULT is checked
  in C and every failure resets the affected table, so a failure crosses the
  boundary as `False` + `last_hresult` - never an exception, never a
  partly-filled table (NFR-011), and `runs_on_success`/`glyphs_on_success`
  cannot be violated from the native side (ISSUE 11).
- **`DWRITE_API` grew a line-breaking surface** (additive; no existing contract
  touched): `analyze_line_breakpoints` over `AnalyzeLineBreakpoints` with a
  REAL `SetLineBreakpoints` sink - the spike's was a stub - plus
  `breakpoint_count`, `break_condition_before`/`_after`, `is_break_whitespace`,
  `is_break_soft_hyphen`. `SCRIPT_ITEMIZER.soft_breaks` consumes these.
  Also `script_analysis_size` + `copy_script_run_analysis`, so `SCRIPT_ITEM`
  can carry a run's analysis bytes verbatim back into `shape_run`.
- **`GDI32_API` bodies are effective**: `create_font` (LOGFONTW,
  `lfHeight = -pixel_size`, `CreateFontIndirectW`), `create_memory_dc`,
  `select_font`, `text_ascent`/`text_descent`, `realized_face_name`
  (`GetTextFaceW` decoded to `STRING_32` - the R1 existence comparator),
  `delete_handle`, `delete_dc`. Plain Win32 externals over `<windows.h>`;
  they deliberately do NOT include the shim header, whose state is `static`.
- **ECF**: `<external_include location="$ECF_CONFIG_PATH/Clib"/>` on BOTH
  targets (ECF-relative, so it resolves in a worktree and for a consumer that
  vendors the library).
- **Test**: `test_dwrite_native_round_trip` drives the whole chain against the
  D-015 probe string and reproduces the spike's measured facts - 3 script runs
  / 2 bidi runs, Hebrew resolved level 1, 19 breakpoints, Segoe UI realized at
  em 16, shalom shaping to 4 glyphs with positive advances and an identity
  cluster map, and `.notdef` = glyph id 0 on the uncovered emoji run. On a
  machine where `open` fails it reports an honest SKIP in its own counter,
  never a pass and never inflating the Phase-5 skeletal count. Suite: **23
  passed, 9 skipped, 0 failed**.

Phase 2 repair pass: the adversarial contract review's 22 findings applied as
contract-level edits (5 HIGH / 6 MEDIUM / 8 LOW / 3 INFO). Seam signatures
freeze here, going into Phase 3. Test suite: 22 passed, 9 skipped (skeletal
Phase-5 markers), 0 failed.

### Changed - BREAKING (signatures freeze after this)
- **Seam 4 carries the per-call policy (R11).**
  `FONT_FALLBACK.font_for (a_text, a_item, a_requested, a_policy: FONT_LIST)`,
  with `require policy_usable: not a_policy.is_empty` and
  `ensure probes_counted`. `LIST_FONT_FALLBACK` walks `a_policy` and no longer
  holds a creation-time list at all - `make (a_probe, a_registry)`.
  `SIMPLE_SHAPING.layout` passes its own `a_fonts`. Previously the walk used
  the list captured when the facade was created, so a layout advertised "under
  policy a_fonts" was fiction beyond the primary face and `set_default_fonts`
  never rewired fallback. **Gate: Larry's Phase 3 approval (pending).**
- **`EMOJI_SEGMENTER.segment` takes a notes accumulator:**
  `segment (a_text, a_bidi, a_notes: ARRAYED_LIST [SHAPING_NOTE])`. Notes only
  grow, and every appended note is `Note_emoji_degraded` - FR-007 rung 3's
  observability was structurally unimplementable without a channel out.
- **`FALLBACK_CHOICE` carries `probes_performed: INTEGER`** (invariant >= 0;
  `make (a_font, a_complete, a_probes)`). The facade adds it into
  `statistics.fallback_probes` through the new
  `SHAPING_STATISTICS.record_fallback_probes`; seam doubles return 0. R7's
  "counted by the calling engine" was otherwise uncountable.
- **`FONT_LIST.digest` and `SIMPLE_SHAPING.cache_key` are injective.** Every
  serialized component is length-prefixed (`count ':' bytes`). Family names may
  contain `;`, `|` and `:`, so bare separators equated `["A;B"]` with
  `["A","B"]` - breaking value equality and letting two policies share one
  cache key.
- **`FONT_LIST.copy` is redefined DEEP** (fresh lists, fresh hash table of
  fresh inner lists; immutable elements shared). Self-copy is guarded as a
  no-op, as EiffelBase's ARRAYED_LIST.copy does. `is_equal` was redefined
  without it, so a `twin` aliased the internals and twin-then-mutate silently
  corrupted the original policy - the simple_chat D5 lesson.
- **`LAYOUT_CACHE` binds R8**: `put` / `item_verified` / `has_verified` carry
  the fonts digest, entries store it (`digests_model`, domain pinned to
  `cache_model`'s by invariant), and a policy mismatch demotes the hit.
- **Noto asset keys pad to four hex digits** (`emoji_u00a9`,
  `emoji_u0023_20e3`). `lower_hex` stripped leading zeros, so copyright,
  registered and every keycap would have probed a nonexistent path and
  degraded to permanent silent tofu the day assets shipped.
- **The test runner counts skips separately.** Each `[skeletal]` Phase-5 marker
  prints an explicit `SKIP` line, and the totals read
  `N passed, M skipped, F failed`. A skipped test can never count as passed.

### Removed
- `SCRIPT_ITEMIZER.itemize`'s `plain_span_only` precondition (and
  `is_emoji_free` with the class's private `EMOJI_DATA_TABLES` once). FR-007
  rung 3 lawfully sends unresolvable pictographs into the glyph path, so the
  precondition made the documented degradation an assertion violation -
  NFR-011's never-raises law broken by a contract. Emoji-freedom is now a
  caller duty stated in the class note; `segment` carries the honest mirror
  ensure for the single-codepoint case.
- `SIMPLE_SHAPING.measured_width`'s vacuous `whitespace_measures` clause; R2's
  measurement half is now bound to the named Phase-5 test
  `test_whitespace_measures_positive_under_realized_font`.

### Added
- `SHAPING_CONSTANTS.runs_at_layout_size` - closes D-S03 same-N as a
  `SHAPED_LAYOUT` invariant and `make` precondition, so a Phase-4 body cannot
  shape at one size and stamp the layout with another.
- `SHAPING_CONSTANTS.is_all_odd` / `is_reversal`, and two free bidi-oracle
  strengthenings: `reorder`'s `rtl_reversal` and `resolve`'s `empty_auto_ltr`.
- Success-and-failure postconditions on `DWRITE_API.analyze` / `shape_run` /
  `open` (`runs_on_success`, `glyphs_on_success`, `failure_reported`), so a
  lying shim is a contract violation at the trust boundary, not a surprise.
- `EMOJI_SEGMENTER.segment` ensures `emoji_levels_inherited` (RTL image
  placement depends on it) and `no_resolvable_single_left_plain`.
- Defensive deep copy in `SIMPLE_SHAPING.set_default_fonts`; `capacity_kept`
  frame on `set_asset_directory`.
- Tests: `test_font_list_twin_is_independent`,
  `test_font_list_digest_is_injective`, Noto padding expectations in
  `test_asset_catalog_key_scheme`, an R8 policy-mismatch demotion assertion.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-01 (pre-release: Phase 1 contracts)

Contract skeletons only. Nothing here shapes text yet: `layout` returns a
degenerate one-line, zero-run layout that satisfies every stated contract
(total function, coverage, caching) while the pipeline bodies await Phase 4.
Pure value classes and pure-logic engines already carry real bodies.

### Added
- The four seams as deferred classes with normative contracts (the
  cross-backend equivalence oracle): `BIDI_RESOLVER`, `SCRIPT_ITEMIZER`,
  `GLYPH_SHAPER`, `FONT_FALLBACK`.
- DirectWrite-first MVP effecting slots (G1 final, backed by the
  spikes/dwrite feasibility spike): `DIRECTWRITE_BIDI_RESOLVER`,
  `DIRECTWRITE_SCRIPT_ITEMIZER`, `DIRECTWRITE_GLYPH_SHAPER` - contract-level
  skeletons whose notes bind the proven plain-C COM-shim pattern
  (AnalyzeScript / AnalyzeBidi / GetGlyphs / GetGlyphPlacements).
  Uniscribe classes are named-only alternate slots; they do not exist yet.
- `LIST_FONT_FALLBACK` (G2): the library's own fallback in every configuration.
- Result model: `SHAPED_LAYOUT` -> `SHAPED_LINE` -> `SHAPED_RUN` closed over
  exactly `GLYPH_RUN` | `IMAGE_RUN`; `SHAPING_NOTE` degradation records.
- Emoji subsystem: `EMOJI_SEGMENTER` (runs after bidi, BEFORE itemization -
  spike-confirmed necessity), `EMOJI_ASSET_CATALOG` (Noto `emoji_u1f916`
  naming; disk-free resolution via an injectable existence probe),
  `EMOJI_DATA_TABLES` (generator-owned; UNPINNED until Phase 3 acquisition).
- `SHAPING_FONT` (same-N holder) + `FONT_REGISTRY` (per-processor ownership).
- `LAYOUT_CACHE`: real LRU with full-key verification on hit (R8).
- `FONT_LIST` (real builder + value-based digest), `SHAPING_STATISTICS`
  (R7 counter definitions), `FALLBACK_CHOICE`, pipeline value classes.
- NULL_* doubles for all four seams with real pure-logic bodies (headless).
- `SIMPLE_SHAPING` facade wired DirectWrite-first; degenerate total-function
  `layout` with the full contract already enforced.
- MML model queries on every collection-bearing class (simple_mml).
- Testing: TEST_APP + LIB_TESTS (real tests where logic is real, skeletal
  Phase-5 assault stubs), SCOOP consumer test, BIDI_CONFORMANCE_HARNESS skeleton.

### Deferred (deliberate, recorded)
- `SHAPING_CAIRO_BRIDGE` + `EMOJI_SURFACE_CACHE`: await the gated simple_cairo
  D-S07 glyph API (no cairo dependency in Phase 1).
- `USP10_API` + `UNISCRIBE_*`: the named alternate backend slot (G1 final).
- Native bodies (dwrite/gdi32 externals), real shaping, wrap, probing: Phase 4.
- Noto png/128 assets + pinned Unicode tables: Phase 3 acquisition (R4).
