## [Unreleased]

### Added - Phase 4, Tasks 6 and 7 (emoji data: assets acquired and tables generated)
- **The Noto Emoji artwork ships.** `assets/noto-emoji/png/128/` - 3,768 PNG
  files, 21,196,457 bytes - extracted from ONE tagged release,
  googlefonts/noto-emoji `v2.051` ("Unicode 17.0 update mk1"), archive sha256
  `04f3d1e5605edebebac00a7a0becb390a4a3ead015066905b27935b30c18e745`. The
  padding rule Phase 2 caught (ISSUE 5) is now verified against the real files:
  `emoji_u00a9.png` and `emoji_u0023_20e3.png` exist, `emoji_ua9.png` and
  `emoji_u23_20e3.png` do not.
- **`LICENSE-ASSETS.md`** at the repository root - the artwork's license and
  attribution, written to ship beside the exe (NFR-009/AC-9). Upstream's own
  root `LICENSE` and `README` disagree at this tag (OFL 1.1 vs Apache-2.0), so
  it carries BOTH texts and says why.
- **`tools/emoji-acquisition.md`** - the R4 record: tag, URL, archive sha256,
  file/byte counts, the Unicode emoji version the release states and where that
  claim comes from, plus the three pinned Unicode data files with their versions
  and sha256s. `tools/emoji-test.txt`, `tools/emoji-zwj-sequences.txt` and
  `tools/emoji-data.txt` (all Emoji 17.0) are committed byte-exact.
- **`tools/generate_emoji_tables.py`** - the D-S08 generator. `--check` exits 1
  when `src/emoji/generated/emoji_data_tables.e` is stale against its inputs.
- **`EMOJI_DATA_TABLES` is generated and real.** `unicode_version` is `"17.0"`
  (was `"UNPINNED-0.0.0"`), so `EMOJI_ASSET_CATALOG`'s
  `tables_and_assets_pinned_together` invariant now pins something.
  `is_extended_pictographic` is a binary search over 156 merged ranges compiled
  into the class - no UCD file is read at run time (D-S08).
- **Additive RGI lookups on `EMOJI_DATA_TABLES`** (Phase 3 gate decision 4, the
  generator emits them; no existing contract touched): `is_rgi_sequence`,
  `longest_rgi_prefix_length`, `without_vs16`, `codepoints_of`, and the
  constants `Rgi_sequence_count` (3,944), `Max_rgi_sequence_length` (9) and
  `Max_rgi_prefix_length` (10). Keys are canonical - VS16 is dropped before
  lookup, exactly as `EMOJI_ASSET_CATALOG.asset_key` drops it - so every lawful
  spelling of a sequence answers the same. These are what Task 8's longest match
  will call.
- **Four real tests** (`test_emoji_tables_pinned_version`,
  `test_emoji_tables_extended_pictographic`, `test_emoji_tables_rgi_sequences`,
  `test_asset_catalog_over_real_assets`), the last one running the catalog over
  the ACTUAL asset directory with a real file probe. Suite: **26 passed, 9
  skipped, 0 failed** (was 22/9/0; the skipped count did not move).

### Known - recorded, not decided here
- Flag PAIRS have no PNG in `v2.051` (upstream keeps waved flags as SVG under
  `third_party/`), so a flag sequence lands on rung 2 of the FR-007 ladder: two
  regional-indicator letter tiles.


Phase 2 repair pass: the adversarial contract review's 22 findings applied as
contract-level edits (5 HIGH / 6 MEDIUM / 8 LOW / 3 INFO). Seam signatures
freeze here, going into Phase 3. Test suite: 22 passed, 9 skipped (skeletal
Phase-5 markers), 0 failed.

### Changed - BREAKING (signatures freeze after this)
- **Seam 4 carries the per-call policy (R11).**
  `FONT_FALLBACK.font_for (a_text, a_item, a_requested, a_policy: FONT_LIST)`,
  with `require policy_usable: not a_policy.is_empty` and
  `ensure probes_counted`. `LIST_FONT_FALLBACK` walks `a_policy` and no longer
  holds a creation-time list at all - `make (a_probe, a_registry)`.
  `SIMPLE_SHAPING.layout` passes its own `a_fonts`. Previously the walk used
  the list captured when the facade was created, so a layout advertised "under
  policy a_fonts" was fiction beyond the primary face and `set_default_fonts`
  never rewired fallback. **Gate: Larry's Phase 3 approval (pending).**
- **`EMOJI_SEGMENTER.segment` takes a notes accumulator:**
  `segment (a_text, a_bidi, a_notes: ARRAYED_LIST [SHAPING_NOTE])`. Notes only
  grow, and every appended note is `Note_emoji_degraded` - FR-007 rung 3's
  observability was structurally unimplementable without a channel out.
- **`FALLBACK_CHOICE` carries `probes_performed: INTEGER`** (invariant >= 0;
  `make (a_font, a_complete, a_probes)`). The facade adds it into
  `statistics.fallback_probes` through the new
  `SHAPING_STATISTICS.record_fallback_probes`; seam doubles return 0. R7's
  "counted by the calling engine" was otherwise uncountable.
- **`FONT_LIST.digest` and `SIMPLE_SHAPING.cache_key` are injective.** Every
  serialized component is length-prefixed (`count ':' bytes`). Family names may
  contain `;`, `|` and `:`, so bare separators equated `["A;B"]` with
  `["A","B"]` - breaking value equality and letting two policies share one
  cache key.
- **`FONT_LIST.copy` is redefined DEEP** (fresh lists, fresh hash table of
  fresh inner lists; immutable elements shared). Self-copy is guarded as a
  no-op, as EiffelBase's ARRAYED_LIST.copy does. `is_equal` was redefined
  without it, so a `twin` aliased the internals and twin-then-mutate silently
  corrupted the original policy - the simple_chat D5 lesson.
- **`LAYOUT_CACHE` binds R8**: `put` / `item_verified` / `has_verified` carry
  the fonts digest, entries store it (`digests_model`, domain pinned to
  `cache_model`'s by invariant), and a policy mismatch demotes the hit.
- **Noto asset keys pad to four hex digits** (`emoji_u00a9`,
  `emoji_u0023_20e3`). `lower_hex` stripped leading zeros, so copyright,
  registered and every keycap would have probed a nonexistent path and
  degraded to permanent silent tofu the day assets shipped.
- **The test runner counts skips separately.** Each `[skeletal]` Phase-5 marker
  prints an explicit `SKIP` line, and the totals read
  `N passed, M skipped, F failed`. A skipped test can never count as passed.

### Removed
- `SCRIPT_ITEMIZER.itemize`'s `plain_span_only` precondition (and
  `is_emoji_free` with the class's private `EMOJI_DATA_TABLES` once). FR-007
  rung 3 lawfully sends unresolvable pictographs into the glyph path, so the
  precondition made the documented degradation an assertion violation -
  NFR-011's never-raises law broken by a contract. Emoji-freedom is now a
  caller duty stated in the class note; `segment` carries the honest mirror
  ensure for the single-codepoint case.
- `SIMPLE_SHAPING.measured_width`'s vacuous `whitespace_measures` clause; R2's
  measurement half is now bound to the named Phase-5 test
  `test_whitespace_measures_positive_under_realized_font`.

### Added
- `SHAPING_CONSTANTS.runs_at_layout_size` - closes D-S03 same-N as a
  `SHAPED_LAYOUT` invariant and `make` precondition, so a Phase-4 body cannot
  shape at one size and stamp the layout with another.
- `SHAPING_CONSTANTS.is_all_odd` / `is_reversal`, and two free bidi-oracle
  strengthenings: `reorder`'s `rtl_reversal` and `resolve`'s `empty_auto_ltr`.
- Success-and-failure postconditions on `DWRITE_API.analyze` / `shape_run` /
  `open` (`runs_on_success`, `glyphs_on_success`, `failure_reported`), so a
  lying shim is a contract violation at the trust boundary, not a surprise.
- `EMOJI_SEGMENTER.segment` ensures `emoji_levels_inherited` (RTL image
  placement depends on it) and `no_resolvable_single_left_plain`.
- Defensive deep copy in `SIMPLE_SHAPING.set_default_fonts`; `capacity_kept`
  frame on `set_asset_directory`.
- Tests: `test_font_list_twin_is_independent`,
  `test_font_list_digest_is_injective`, Noto padding expectations in
  `test_asset_catalog_key_scheme`, an R8 policy-mismatch demotion assertion.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-01 (pre-release: Phase 1 contracts)

Contract skeletons only. Nothing here shapes text yet: `layout` returns a
degenerate one-line, zero-run layout that satisfies every stated contract
(total function, coverage, caching) while the pipeline bodies await Phase 4.
Pure value classes and pure-logic engines already carry real bodies.

### Added
- The four seams as deferred classes with normative contracts (the
  cross-backend equivalence oracle): `BIDI_RESOLVER`, `SCRIPT_ITEMIZER`,
  `GLYPH_SHAPER`, `FONT_FALLBACK`.
- DirectWrite-first MVP effecting slots (G1 final, backed by the
  spikes/dwrite feasibility spike): `DIRECTWRITE_BIDI_RESOLVER`,
  `DIRECTWRITE_SCRIPT_ITEMIZER`, `DIRECTWRITE_GLYPH_SHAPER` - contract-level
  skeletons whose notes bind the proven plain-C COM-shim pattern
  (AnalyzeScript / AnalyzeBidi / GetGlyphs / GetGlyphPlacements).
  Uniscribe classes are named-only alternate slots; they do not exist yet.
- `LIST_FONT_FALLBACK` (G2): the library's own fallback in every configuration.
- Result model: `SHAPED_LAYOUT` -> `SHAPED_LINE` -> `SHAPED_RUN` closed over
  exactly `GLYPH_RUN` | `IMAGE_RUN`; `SHAPING_NOTE` degradation records.
- Emoji subsystem: `EMOJI_SEGMENTER` (runs after bidi, BEFORE itemization -
  spike-confirmed necessity), `EMOJI_ASSET_CATALOG` (Noto `emoji_u1f916`
  naming; disk-free resolution via an injectable existence probe),
  `EMOJI_DATA_TABLES` (generator-owned; UNPINNED until Phase 3 acquisition).
- `SHAPING_FONT` (same-N holder) + `FONT_REGISTRY` (per-processor ownership).
- `LAYOUT_CACHE`: real LRU with full-key verification on hit (R8).
- `FONT_LIST` (real builder + value-based digest), `SHAPING_STATISTICS`
  (R7 counter definitions), `FALLBACK_CHOICE`, pipeline value classes.
- NULL_* doubles for all four seams with real pure-logic bodies (headless).
- `SIMPLE_SHAPING` facade wired DirectWrite-first; degenerate total-function
  `layout` with the full contract already enforced.
- MML model queries on every collection-bearing class (simple_mml).
- Testing: TEST_APP + LIB_TESTS (real tests where logic is real, skeletal
  Phase-5 assault stubs), SCOOP consumer test, BIDI_CONFORMANCE_HARNESS skeleton.

### Deferred (deliberate, recorded)
- `SHAPING_CAIRO_BRIDGE` + `EMOJI_SURFACE_CACHE`: await the gated simple_cairo
  D-S07 glyph API (no cairo dependency in Phase 1).
- `USP10_API` + `UNISCRIBE_*`: the named alternate backend slot (G1 final).
- Native bodies (dwrite/gdi32 externals), real shaping, wrap, probing: Phase 4.
- Noto png/128 assets + pinned Unicode tables: Phase 3 acquisition (R4).
